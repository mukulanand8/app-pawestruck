    <!--DiscourageActivity-->
    <string name="discourage_gender">Sorry, we discourage adoption based on the gender of the animal. Why? Because
        we want to put away the stereotype that a female pet is inferior to a male pet. A female pet is as playful
        as a male one. As loving as a male one. As loyal as a male one. As fierce as a male one. Worried that a
        female pet would give birth to another litter? Please consult your local shelter about Sterilisation/ Animal
        Birth Control (ABC). This is suggested for both male and female pets. Refer to the Sterilisation section on
        the FAQ page for more details. Please don\'t discriminate by gender! All animals are equally lovely!</string>
    <string name="discourage_breed">Sorry, we discourage adoption based on the breed of the animal. Why? Because we
        condemn breeders who just look for \"exotic-breed\" animals, abuse them, abandon them and make money out of
        this cruel practice (Refer FAQs for more details).\n\nThe breed of the pet doesn\'t entirely determine its
        temperament. We have come across super-friendly Pitbulls and aggressive Golden Retrievers. If you\'re looking
        for a pet with specific behavioural traits, please visit and get along with the pet before taking him/her
        home. Please don\'t discriminate by breed! All animals are equally lovely!</string>

    <string name="supp_answer1">If you\'re someone wanting to adopt a pet, you\'d probably have to search
        across multiple social media pages and newspaper listings and travel to several animal shelters.
        Or you could be a part of a relatively unknown animal shelter struggling to find homes for your animals.
        Pawestruck aims to solve this issue by providing a universal platform to post adoption alerts.</string>
    <string name="supp_answer2">1. This app is purely meant for adoptions. Any post regarding selling of a pet
        (for money) will be taken down immediately with the user receiving a permanent ban.
        If you find someone selling a pet, please click the <i>Report</i> button on the post so that we can
        review it and take it down.\n\n2. Please ensure that the animal you put up for adoption is
        in good health with vaccinations up-to-date.\n\n3. In case of a senior dog or a cat, please
        spay/neuter (sterilise) him/her so that he/she doesn\'t end up getting exploited by a breeder.\n\n4.
        Give your pet up responsibly! It is up to you to find safe hands to take care of your pet. Remember,
        animals have feelings too!\n\n5. If you\'re an adopter, note that posts specifying the inclusion of a
        health card are more credible.\n\nThank you for going through this long section and sticking to the rules!
        Here, have a treat! &#127850;</string>
    <string name="supp_answer3">Of course! But when our userbase grows, please bear our ads since we need revenue to
        keep the servers running. Thank you!</string>
    <string name="supp_answer4">You don\'t need an account unless you want to post an adoption alert, report a post
        or bookmark a post. And our Sign Up page is as simple as it gets-
        Username, E-mail and Password will do!</string>
    <string name="supp_answer5">Yes, we\'d encourage using a single account for an organization
        instead of different individual accounts representing the same organization.</string>
    <string name="supp_answer6">That\'s alright, we respect your privacy! You don\'t need
        to provide your phone number or your complete address but choosing at least a state, city or
        locality as the address would be helpful in filtering posts. The e-mail address,
        however, is publicly visible as a means of contact when you post an adoption alert.</string>
    <string name="supp_answer7">Yes, a picture is mandatory. We support a maximum of 4 photos per post and
        video uploads aren\'t supported yet!</string>
    <string name="supp_answer8">Glad to hear! Please delete your post to keep the adoption list clean and to avoid further
        queries about your pet.</string>

    <string name="supp_answer9">By choosing to adopt, you don\'t just give a new life to the pet you\'re adopting;
        you also help out animal shelters or individuals who would already be taking care of a lot of animals. This
        would also help put an end to breeding for the sake of money. Now… isn\'t this heroic? Wouldn\'t you want to
        be a Superhero too?</string>
    <string name="supp_answer10">Well, would you like to see an animal suffer? Neither do we. Sadly, in a lot of
        places, breeders take hold of animals, lock them up in a dark place, load them with drugs, force them to give
        birth over and over again while their innocent little ones are sold. Then, once they are sick or can no longer
        be used for breeding, the poor creatures are often dumped on the streets where they struggle to survive. The
        only motive behind this cruelty is money.\n\nThere could be some genuine, kind-hearted breeders out there but
        sorry, we don\'t want to risk it! Pawestruck still says NO to breeders!</string>
    <string name="supp_answer11">A female cat or dog can give birth up to thrice a year with each litter having about
        7 little ones. Theoretically, this <b>one</b> cat/dog (with each offspring, their offspring and so on…)
        could result in the birth of over 11,000 cats/dogs a year! Is it ethical to allow litters of pups or kittens
        to be born knowing that they wouldn\'t survive past few days? And who\'d look after the offspring when your
        pet mates? Sterilisation also reduces aggression and lowers the risk of certain diseases. We support this
        humane action \"for the greater good\".</string>
    <string name="supp_answer12">Vacc answer</string>

    <string name="supp_answer13">No biggie! You need to verify either your e-mail address or phone number to post.
        On signing up, you will be sent a link to verify your account. You could either verify via the link or
        click the <i>Edit</i> icon next to phone number in the Profile page and verify your phone number via OTP.
        Please note that a verified phone number will be displayed in the post publicly.</string>
    <string name="supp_answer14">Aah, too late! This happens when the user has deleted their post. This probably means that
        the pet has found a home already!</string>
    <string name="supp_answer15">Hmm… have you checked your Internet connection? Have you tried doing it again?
        If you can\'t create an account, sign out, bookmark, filter, add an adoption alert, change your profile picture,
        verify your mobile number or set a location successfully, it is highly likely that the Internet connection (Mobile
        Data or WiFi) that you\'re using is poor. Please let us know if the error persists despite a good connection by
        mailing us at pawestruckapp@gmail.com.</string>
    <string name="supp_answer16">Wait! Please don\'t! If you have any queries, suggestions or bug reports,
        we\'d be happy to hear you out and assist! Mail us at pawestruckapp@gmail.com.</string>
